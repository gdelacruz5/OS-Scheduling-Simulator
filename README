Simulates different OS scheduling algorithms. Specifically, shortest-remaining job next, first-in first-out, and round-robin algorithms are simulated.

Usage:
schedSim <job-file.txt> -p <ALGORITHM> -q <QUANTUM>

    â€¢ job-file.txt contains a list of job run and arrival times, given as a pair of integers, each on their own line. Note: There should be no restrictions on how jobs appear in job-file.txt; e.g. jobs may be written out of order and may arrive at the same time1. Job files are formatted as:
8 0

Questions:
1) When the jobs all have around the same burst times. 
2) When the jobs all have around the same burst time and arrive at regular
   intervals that are a little less than the quantum.
3) As the average job length increases the response time increases. The 
   simulator can demonstrate this trend by comparing the average response
   times for an input file with shorter average job lengths and an input
   file with longer average job lengths.
4) As quantum lengths increase the response time increases. Given a big
   enough quantum the worst case response time given N jobs is 
   (N * average burst time).
