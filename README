Questions:
1) When the jobs all have around the same burst times. 
2) When the jobs all have around the same burst time and arrive at regular
   intervals that are a little less than the quantum.
3) As the average job length increases the response time increases. The 
   simulator can demonstrate this trend by comparing the average response
   times for an input file with shorter average job lengths and an input
   file with longer average job lengths.
4) As quantum lengths increase the response time increases. Given a big
   enough quantum the worst case response time given N jobs is 
   (N * average burst time).
